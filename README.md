## What is Camera WIFI?

Camera WIFI is not a traditional Camera App but itâ€™s something different.
I writed this Application to create a stream of images between Phone and PC.

You can download from Google Play here:
* [Camera WIFI FREE (with ADS)](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.edodm85.cameratcp.free)
* [Camera WIFI (without ADS)](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.edodm85.cameratcp.paid)

<br>

## How does it work?

1. Connect Phone and PC over the same network

2. Open the Application Camera WIFI on phone

4. Insert the ip address of the Phone and press Connect

5. Press snap button and acquire the image

## Building PhoneTCPClient

For build [PhoneTCPClient](https://github.com/edodm85/CameraWIFI/tree/master/PhoneTCPClient%20Source%20Code) you need Visual Studio 2013 or above.

<br>

## Create your Client (Camera WIFI v3.0.0 or higher)

The protocol description is here: https://github.com/edodm85/DOT_Protocol_Specification

#### COMMANDS FOR RECEIVED IMAGES

1. START ACQUISITION: Send this array: [0xAA 0x1 0x0 0x0 0x0 0x3 0x1 0x11 0x55]

2. STOP ACQUISITION: Send this array: [0xAA 0x1 0x0 0x0 0x0 0x3 0x1 0x12 0x55]

3. ACQUIRE ONE IMAGE: Send this array: [0xAA 0x1 0x0 0x0 0x0 0x3 0x1 0x10 0x55]

#### RECEIVE IMAGES FROM CAMERA WIFI

The App sends an image, with this Bytes sequence: [0xAA 0x1 LENGHT 0x5 PAYLOAD 0x55]

## (DEPRECATED) Create your Client (All versions)

Camera WIFI accepts these commands via wifi:

#### COMMANDS FOR RECEIVED IMAGES

1. START ACQUISITION: Send the string "startGRAB"

2. STOP ACQUISITION: Send the string "stopGRAB"

3. ACQUIRE ONE IMAGE: Send the string "singleSNAP"

#### RECEIVE IMAGES FROM CAMERA WIFI

The App sends an image, in the first place it adds the string "sRt" and in the end the string "sTp".

So the client receives: "sRt" - Bytes image - "sTp"


#### COMMANDS FOR ENABLE/DISABLE SOME FUNCTIONS

1. ENABLE FLASH: Send the string "flashON"

2. DISABLE FLASH: Send the string "flashOFF"
          
3. ENABLE AUTOFOCUS: Send the string "focusON"

4. DISABLE AUTOFOCUS: Send the string "focusOFF"
